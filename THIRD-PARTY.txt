A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
==========================

Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.

In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
software.

In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became
Zope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see
https://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization
created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.
Zope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.

All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
the various releases.

    Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-
                    from                                compatible? (1)

    0.9.0 thru 1.2              1991-1995   CWI         yes
    1.3 thru 1.5.2  1.2         1995-1999   CNRI        yes
    1.6             1.5.2       2000        CNRI        no
    2.0             1.6         2000        BeOpen.com  no
    1.6.1           1.6         2001        CNRI        yes (2)
    2.1             2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         no
    2.0.1           2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         yes
    2.1.1           2.1+2.0.1   2001        PSF         yes
    2.1.2           2.1.1       2002        PSF         yes
    2.1.3           2.1.2       2002        PSF         yes
    2.2 and above   2.1.1       2001-now    PSF         yes

Footnotes:

(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
    the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.

(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
    is "not incompatible" with the GPL.

Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
direction to make these releases possible.

3.  Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
    (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
    use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
    where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
    by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
    Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
    with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
    institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
    or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
    as of the date such litigation is filed.

4.  Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
    Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
    meet the following conditions:

    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
    Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that You changed the files; and

    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
    that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
    attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
    excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
    the Derivative Works; and

    (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
    distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
    include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
    within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
    pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
    of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
    as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
    documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
    within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
    wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
    of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
    do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
    notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
    or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
    that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
    as modifying the License.

    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
    the conditions stated in this License.

5.  Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6.  Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7.  Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8.  Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9.  Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

The following npm package may be included in this product:

 - saxes@5.0.1

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# saxes

A sax-style non-validating parser for XML.

Saxes is a fork of [sax](https://github.com/isaacs/sax-js) 1.2.4. All mentions
of sax in this project's documentation are references to sax 1.2.4.

Designed with [node](http://nodejs.org/) in mind, but should work fine in the
browser or other CommonJS implementations.

Saxes does not support Node versions older than 10.

## Notable Differences from Sax.

* Saxes aims to be much stricter than sax with regards to XML
  well-formedness. Sax, even in its so-called "strict mode", is not strict. It
  silently accepts structures that are not well-formed XML. Projects that need
  better compliance with well-formedness constraints cannot use sax as-is.

  Consequently, saxes does not support HTML, or pseudo-XML, or bad XML. Saxes
  will report well-formedness errors in all these cases but it won't try to
  extract data from malformed documents like sax does.

* Saxes is much much faster than sax, mostly because of a substantial redesign
  of the internal parsing logic. The speed improvement is not merely due to
  removing features that were supported by sax. That helped a bit, but saxes
  adds some expensive checks in its aim for conformance with the XML
  specification. Redesigning the parsing logic is what accounts for most of the
  performance improvement.

* Saxes does not aim to support antiquated platforms. We will not pollute the
  source or the default build with support for antiquated platforms. If you want
  support for IE 11, you are welcome to produce a PR that adds a *new build*
  transpiled to ES5.

* Saxes handles errors differently from sax: it provides a default onerror
  handler which throws. You can replace it with your own handler if you want. If
  your handler does nothing, there is no `resume` method to call.

* There's no `Stream` API. A revamped API may be introduced later. (It is still
  a "streaming parser" in the general sense that you write a character stream to
  it.)

* Saxes does not have facilities for limiting the size the data chunks passed to
  event handlers. See the FAQ entry for more details.

## Conformance

Saxes supports:

* [XML 1.0 fifth edition](https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xml-20081126/)
* [XML 1.1 second edition](https://www.w3.org/TR/2006/REC-xml11-20060816/)
* [Namespaces in XML 1.0 (Third Edition)](https://www.w3.org/TR/2009/REC-xml-names-20091208/).
* [Namespaces in XML 1.1 (Second Edition)](https://www.w3.org/TR/2006/REC-xml-names11-20060816/).

## Limitations

This is a non-validating parser so it only verifies whether the document is
well-formed. We do aim to raise errors for all malformed constructs
encountered. However, this parser does not thorougly parse the contents of
DTDs. So most malformedness errors caused by errors **in DTDs** cannot be
reported.

## Regarding `<!DOCTYPE` and `<!ENTITY`

The parser will handle the basic XML entities in text nodes and attribute
values: `&amp; &lt; &gt; &apos; &quot;`. It's possible to define additional
entities in XML by putting them in the DTD. This parser doesn't do anything with
that. If you want to listen to the `doctype` event, and then fetch the
doctypes, and read the entities and add them to `parser.ENTITIES`, then be my
guest.

## Documentation

The source code contains JSDOC comments. Use them. What follows is a brief
summary of what is available. The final authority is the source code.

**PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO WHAT IS PUBLIC AND WHAT IS PRIVATE.**

The move to TypeScript makes it so that everything is now formally private,
protected, or public.

If you use anything not public, that's at your own peril.

If there's a mistake in the documentation, raise an issue. If you just assume,
you may assume incorrectly.

## Summary Usage Information

### Example

```javascript
var saxes = require("./lib/saxes"),
  parser = new saxes.SaxesParser();

parser.on("error", function (e) {
  // an error happened.
});
parser.on("text", function (t) {
  // got some text.  t is the string of text.
});
parser.on("opentag", function (node) {
  // opened a tag.  node has "name" and "attributes"
});
parser.on("end", function () {
  // parser stream is done, and ready to have more stuff written to it.
});

parser.write('<xml>Hello, <who name="world">world</who>!</xml>').close();
```

### Constructor Arguments

Settings supported:

* `xmlns` - Boolean. If `true`, then namespaces are supported. Default
  is `false`.

* `position` - Boolean. If `false`, then don't track line/col/position. Unset is
  treated as `true`. Default is unset. Currently, setting this to `false` only
  results in a cosmetic change: the errors reported do not contain position
  information. sax-js would literally turn off the position-computing logic if
  this flag was set to false. The notion was that it would optimize
  execution. In saxes at least it turns out that continually testing this flag
  causes a cost that offsets the benefits of turning off this logic.

* `fileName` - String. Set a file name for error reporting. This is useful only
  when tracking positions. You may leave it unset.

* `fragment` - Boolean. If `true`, parse the XML as an XML fragment. Default is
  `false`.

* `additionalNamespaces` - A plain object whose key, value pairs define
   namespaces known before parsing the XML file. It is not legal to pass
   bindings for the namespaces `"xml"` or `"xmlns"`.

* `defaultXMLVersion` - The default version of the XML specification to use if
  the document contains no XML declaration. If the document does contain an XML
  declaration, then this setting is ignored. Must be `"1.0"` or `"1.1"`. The
  default is `"1.0"`.

* `forceXMLVersion` - Boolean. A flag indicating whether to force the XML
  version used for parsing to the value of ``defaultXMLVersion``. When this flag
  is ``true``, ``defaultXMLVersion`` must be specified. If unspecified, the
  default value of this flag is ``false``.

  Example: suppose you are parsing a document that has an XML declaration
  specifying XML version 1.1.

  If you set ``defaultXMLVersion`` to ``"1.0"`` without setting
  ``forceXMLVersion`` then the XML declaration will override the value of
  ``defaultXMLVersion`` and the document will be parsed according to XML 1.1.

  If you set ``defaultXMLVersion`` to ``"1.0"`` and set ``forceXMLVersion`` to
  ``true``, then the XML declaration will be ignored and the document will be
  parsed according to XML 1.0.

### Methods

`write` - Write bytes onto the stream. You don't have to pass the whole document
in one `write` call. You can read your source chunk by chunk and call `write`
with each chunk.

`close` - Close the stream. Once closed, no more data may be written until it is
done processing the buffer, which is signaled by the `end` event.

### Properties

The parser has the following properties:

`line`, `column`, `columnIndex`, `position` - Indications of the position in the
XML document where the parser currently is looking. The `columnIndex` property
counts columns as if indexing into a JavaScript string, whereas the `column`
property counts Unicode characters.

`closed` - Boolean indicating whether or not the parser can be written to.  If
it's `true`, then wait for the `ready` event to write again.

`opt` - Any options passed into the constructor.

`xmlDecl` - The XML declaration for this document. It contains the fields
`version`, `encoding` and `standalone`. They are all `undefined` before
encountering the XML declaration. If they are undefined after the XML
declaration, the corresponding value was not set by the declaration. There is no
event associated with the XML declaration. In a well-formed document, the XML
declaration may be preceded only by an optional BOM. So by the time any event
generated by the parser happens, the declaration has been processed if present
at all. Otherwise, you have a malformed document, and as stated above, you
cannot rely on the parser data!

### Error Handling

The parser continues to parse even upon encountering errors, and does its best
to continue reporting errors. You should heed all errors reported. After an
error, however, saxes may interpret your document incorrectly. For instance
``<foo a=bc="d"/>`` is invalid XML. Did you mean to have ``<foo a="bc=d"/>`` or
``<foo a="b" c="d"/>`` or some other variation?  For the sake of continuing to
provide errors, saxes will continue parsing the document, but the structure it
reports may be incorrect. It is only after the errors are fixed in the document
that saxes can provide a reliable interpretation of the document.

That leaves you with two rules of thumb when using saxes:

* Pay attention to the errors that saxes report. The default `onerror` handler
  throws, so by default, you cannot miss errors.

* **ONCE AN ERROR HAS BEEN ENCOUNTERED, STOP RELYING ON THE EVENT HANDLERS OTHER
  THAN `onerror`.** As explained above, when saxes runs into a well-formedness
  problem, it makes a guess in order to continue reporting more errors. The guess
  may be wrong.

### Events

To listen to an event, override `on<eventname>`. The list of supported events
are also in the exported `EVENTS` array.

See the JSDOC comments in the source code for a description of each supported
event.

### Parsing XML Fragments

The XML specification does not define any method by which to parse XML
fragments. However, there are usage scenarios in which it is desirable to parse
fragments. In order to allow this, saxes provides three initialization options.

If you pass the option `fragment: true` to the parser constructor, the parser
will expect an XML fragment. It essentially starts with a parsing state
equivalent to the one it would be in if `parser.write("<foo">)` had been called
right after initialization. In other words, it expects content which is
acceptable inside an element. This also turns off well-formedness checks that
are inappropriate when parsing a fragment.

The option `additionalNamespaces` allows you to define additional prefix-to-URI
bindings known before parsing starts. You would use this over `resolvePrefix` if
you have at the ready a series of namespaces bindings to use.

The option `resolvePrefix` allows you to pass a function which saxes will use if
it is unable to resolve a namespace prefix by itself. You would use this over
`additionalNamespaces` in a context where getting a complete list of defined
namespaces is onerous.

Note that you can use `additionalNamespaces` and `resolvePrefix` together if you
want. `additionalNamespaces` applies before `resolvePrefix`.

The options `additionalNamespaces` and `resolvePrefix` are really meant to be
used for parsing fragments. However, saxes won't prevent you from using them
with `fragment: false`. Note that if you do this, your document may parse
without errors and yet be malformed because the document can refer to namespaces
which are not defined *in* the document.

Of course, `additionalNamespaces` and `resolvePrefix` are used only if `xmlns`
is `true`. If you are parsing a fragment that does not use namespaces, there's
no point in setting these options.

### Performance Tips

* saxes works faster on files that use newlines (``\u000A``) as end of line
  markers than files that use other end of line markers (like ``\r`` or
  ``\r\n``). The XML specification requires that conformant applications behave
  as if all characters that are to be treated as end of line characters are
  converted to ``\u000A`` prior to parsing. The optimal code path for saxes is a
  file in which all end of line characters are already ``\u000A``.

* Don't split Unicode strings you feed to saxes across surrogates. When you
  naively split a string in JavaScript, you run the risk of splitting a Unicode
  character into two surrogates. e.g.  In the following example ``a`` and ``b``
  each contain half of a single Unicode character: ``const a = "\u{1F4A9}"[0];
  const b = "\u{1F4A9}"[1]`` If you feed such split surrogates to versions of
  saxes prior to 4, you'd get errors. Saxes version 4 and over are able to
  detect when a chunk of data ends with a surrogate and carry over the surrogate
  to the next chunk. However this operation entails slicing and concatenating
  strings. If you can feed your data in a way that does not split surrogates,
  you should do it. (Obviously, feeding all the data at once with a single write
  is fastest.)

* Don't set event handlers you don't need. Saxes has always aimed to avoid doing
  work that will just be tossed away but future improvements hope to do this
  more aggressively. One way saxes knows whether or not some data is needed is
  by checking whether a handler has been set for a specific event.

## FAQ

Q. Why has saxes dropped support for limiting the size of data chunks passed to
event handlers?

A. With sax you could set ``MAX_BUFFER_LENGTH`` to cause the parser to limit the
size of data chunks passed to event handlers. So if you ran into a span of text
above the limit, multiple ``text`` events with smaller data chunks were fired
instead of a single event with a large chunk.

However, that functionality had some problematic characteristics. It had an
arbitrary default value. It was library-wide so all parsers created from a
single instance of the ``sax`` library shared it. This could potentially cause
conflicts among libraries running in the same VM but using sax for different
purposes.

These issues could have been easily fixed, but there were larger issues. The
buffer limit arbitrarily applied to some events but not others. It would split
``text``, ``cdata`` and ``script`` events. However, if a ``comment``,
``doctype``, ``attribute`` or ``processing instruction`` were more than the
limit, the parser would generate an error and you were left picking up the
pieces.

It was not intuitive to use. You'd think setting the limit to 1K would prevent
chunks bigger than 1K to be passed to event handlers. But that was not the
case. A comment in the source code told you that you might go over the limit if
you passed large chunks to ``write``. So if you want a 1K limit, don't pass 64K
chunks to ``write``. Fair enough. You know what limit you want so you can
control the size of the data you pass to ``write``. So you limit the chunks to
``write`` to 1K at a time. Even if you do this, your event handlers may get data
chunks that are 2K in size. Suppose on the previous ``write`` the parser has
just finished processing an open tag, so it is ready for text. Your ``write``
passes 1K of text. You are not above the limit yet, so no event is generated
yet. The next ``write`` passes another 1K of text. It so happens that sax checks
buffer limits only once per ``write``, after the chunk of data has been
processed. Now you've hit the limit and you get a ``text`` event with 2K of
data. So even if you limit your ``write`` calls to the buffer limit you've set,
you may still get events with chunks at twice the buffer size limit you've
specified.

We may consider reinstating an equivalent functionality, provided that it
addresses the issues above and does not cause a huge performance drop for
use-case scenarios that don't need it.
